# Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub pit stop 🛠️

🚧 About Me

	•	🧑‍💻 Dev in a service-based firm - WITCH (where tickets arrive faster than salary hikes)
	•	🚀 On a mission to switch lanes to a “roadways” company (read: product-based 🛣️)
	•	📚 Learning DSA to unlock the gates of FAANG & free snacks

🔧 Tech Stack

	•	☕ Java (classic stress with semicolons)
	•	🌐 Node.js + React (aka frontend-backend biryani)
	•	🐞 Debugging pro — except when it comes to my life
 


📊 Stats That Hurt

	•	⏳ LeetCode streak: hanging by a thread
	•	⌨️ DSA grind: 1 hour daily (post-corporate chaos)
	•	😵‍💫 Binary Search bugs: infinite loop of pain
    •	🤖 Professinal Promt Engineer

🎯 Roadmap

	•	✅ Stop fearing pointers
	•	✅ Solve “medium” without emotional damage
	•	🔜 Crack a product-based role & finally sleep on weekends

😂 Fun Fact

I once fixed a prod bug faster than cooking Maggi… and no, I didn’t undercook it.
