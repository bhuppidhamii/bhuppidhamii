🚗 Who am I?
	•	🧑‍💻 I currently work in a service-based company — yes, the land of never-ending client calls and tickets that magically appear at 5:59 PM.
	•	🧭 I’m on a mission to switch lanes — from service-based to “roadways” (read: product-based 🛣️), because I heard they give you snacks, stock options, and weekends back.
	•	🧠 Learning Data Structures & Algorithms to decode the secret interview rituals of FAANG and friends.

💼 Tech Stack (aka: what I’ve broken and fixed repeatedly):
	•	☕ Java (yes, the one with semicolons and stack overflow-inducing errors)
	•	🌐 Node.js, React (because every resume needs a JavaScript sandwich)
	•	🖥️ VS Code (a.k.a. my second home)
	•	🐛 Debugging skills: 9/10 — I can debug anything except my life

📈 My current stats:
	•	📚 LeetCode streak: Alive but struggling
	•	⏰ Time spent on DSA: 1 hour/day (after escaping office chaos)
	•	😵‍💫 Number of times I cried over a single binary search bug: ∞

🎯 Goals:
	•	☑️ Understand pointers without crying
	•	☑️ Solve “medium” DSA problems without existential crisis
	•	⏳ Crack product-based interviews and tell the tale

😎 Fun Fact:

I once debugged a production bug faster than I boiled Maggi — and that’s saying something!
